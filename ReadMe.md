ðŸ‘‹ I'm @KShindle
I'm interested in python and automation, especially related to GIS.
I'm currently learning about GIS application development with JavaScript and GIS project management.
When I'm not on a computer, I like to read, sew, garden, make soaps/candles, freshwater aquarium keeping, and generally hide in the woods and talk to my animals.
